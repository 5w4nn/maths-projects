# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements linear regression using NumPy without any ML libraries.

## Goals
- Understand the linear model mathematically
- Implement it using matrix algebra
- Visualize results
- (Optional) Practice optimization with gradient descent

## Math Background
Explain the normal equation and how it works:
θ=(X 
T
 X) 
−1
 X 
T
 y

## Next Steps
- Try with multi-dimensional data
- Implement gradient descent
